# safe space

my personal corner of the internet. a place to write, think out loud, and document what i'm building and learning.

**live at:** [balthazarvsbotware.github.io](https://balthazarvsbotware.github.io)

## what is this

a single-file personal site that doubles as a full CMS — pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS. no frameworks, no build tools. just a text editor and a browser.

every section is editable from the site itself when logged in. content is stored in a [Supabase](https://supabase.com) database (open source, MIT-licensed client). journal and dashboard entries use a [Quill](https://quilljs.com) rich text editor (BSD-3-Clause). only i can log in — public signups are disabled.

comes with a companion PWA — **Bal's Builders Journal** — a fully offline journal, productivity suite, and trade tools app at [/journal/](https://balthazarvsbotware.github.io/journal/).
